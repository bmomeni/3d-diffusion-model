# 3d-diffusion-model
Hybrid individual-based modeling of microbial activities along with the diffusion of influential chemicals in 3D

Diffusion and cell activity are modeled at two different length-scales (grid size) and time-scales (simulation time-step)
In this version, the release rate and consumption rate are scaled with cell biomass
For more details of the model and implementation, see
